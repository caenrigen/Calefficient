Our privacy policy is short and transparent.

## Nitty-gritty
At the moment we do not collect any personal information of any kind from the users of Calefficient. Simple as that!
We collect only **anonymous** add-on usage statistics. These include:

- Add-on menu clicks (which menu options are used and how many times).

## What data is processed?
The add-on processes all the information from the user's calendars in the servers managed by Google.
No personal information about the user is available to the Calefficient team.
