<!-- # Start with why -->

Nature made time and energy are our most scarce resources. We believe that every single person can make the most of these resources and achieve their full potential. This is why we created Calefficient.

<!-- ## What is it about? -->

Calefficient allows you to know how you spent your time. Allocate time to the most important things in your life and Calefficient will chart your time balance at any moment of the week.

# How it works?

Calefficient is a Google Spreadsheet Add-on. It analyzes the events in your Google Calendars and generates statistics sheets and charts on how you spent your time for a given period, e.g. current week or last month.

Schedule and log your activities in your Google Calendar, Calefficient will handle the rest :)
